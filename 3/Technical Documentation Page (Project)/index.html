            <p>Computer Architecture is the design and organization of a computer's components and systems. It defines the structure of the hardware, including the central processing unit (CPU), memory, and input/output devices.</p>
            <p>Key components of computer architecture include:</p>
            <code>CPU, RAM, Cache, Storage, I/O devices</code>
            <ul>
                <li>CPU is the brain of the computer</li>
                <li>Memory stores data and instructions for the CPU</li>
                <li>Cache improves the speed of the CPU</li>
                <li>Storage devices retain data permanently</li>
                <li>I/O devices allow communication between the computer and external systems</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Digital Logic is the foundation of modern electronics and computer systems. It uses binary signals (0s and 1s) to represent and manipulate data.</p>
            <p>Key concepts include:</p>
            <code>AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR gates</code>
            <ul>
                <li>AND gate outputs true if both inputs are true</li>
                <li>OR gate outputs true if either input is true</li>
                <li>NOT gate inverts the input value</li>
                <li>NAND and NOR are inverses of AND and OR gates</li>
                <li>XOR gate outputs true if inputs are different</li>
            </ul>

            <p>An Operating System (OS) manages computer hardware and software resources and provides services for computer programs. It acts as an intermediary between users and hardware.</p>
            <p>Popular operating systems include:</p>
            <code>Windows, Linux, macOS, Android, iOS</code>
            <ul>
                <li>OS provides memory management and process scheduling</li>
                <li>It handles file management and device control</li>
                <li>Multitasking allows multiple processes to run simultaneously</li>
                <li>Security is managed through user authentication and access control</li>
                <li>Networking features enable communication between computers</li>
            </ul>

            <header>Microprocessors</header>
            <p>Microprocessors are the central unit of embedded systems, acting as the brain of the system. They execute instructions to perform tasks like arithmetic operations and control functions.</p>
            <p>Components of microprocessors include:</p>
            <code>ALU, Control Unit, Registers</code>
            <ul>
                <li>ALU performs arithmetic and logical operations</li>
                <li>The Control Unit manages the execution of instructions</li>
                <li>Registers are small, high-speed storage locations</li>
                <li>Microprocessors are the heart of most computing devices</li>
                <li>They are designed for speed and power efficiency</li>
            </ul>

            <header>Networking</header>
            <p>Networking involves the interconnection of computers and devices to share resources such as files, printers, and internet access. It is essential for communication and data exchange.</p>
            <p>Common networking components include:</p>
            <code>Router, Switch, Hub, Modem, Cables</code>
            <ul>
                <li>Routers direct data traffic between networks</li>
                <li>Switches connect devices within a network</li>
                <li>Hubs are used to connect multiple devices but can cause collisions</li>
                <li>Modems provide access to the internet by modulating and demodulating signals</li>
                <li>Cables provide the physical connection between network components</li>
